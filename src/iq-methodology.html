                    <h2>Answer Methodology</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this site isn't to practice possible software engineering interview questions 
                        so you will have the answers memorized. The chances you will be asked any practice questions 
                        during an actual interview is low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benefit you can get out of this site is practicing the way you approach coding questions 
                        you may get during an interview. If you build up your brain muscles to analyze and break 
                        down a problem systematically, it can give you confidence and help you be ready for almost any 
                        problem.

                    <h1>Clarify</h1>
                    <p>
                        Ask questions to make sure you understand the problem you need to solve. Walk through the state 
                        of the problem before your solution and what should be the expected outcome.
                    </p>
                    <div class="circle">2</div>
                    <h1>Examples</h1>
                    <p>
                        Make sure you have some examples of what a correct solution looks like. This will help you design 
                        the solution and you can use the examples as test case input after you finish coding.
                    </p>
                    <div class="circle">3</div>
                    <h1>Design</h1>
                    <p>
                        Don't jump right into coding. Think through the data structures that will create the most optimal 
                        solution. Think through iterations you need and design the solution before you code.
                    </p>
                    <div class="circle">4</div>
                    <h1>Code</h1>
                    <p>
                        Once you have a clear picture of the problem you need to solve, example "solved" output and 
                        a design write that code! Pseudo code is the best approach unless your interview wants a specific 
                        language so you can focus on logic over syntax.
                    </p>
                    <div class="circle">5</div>
                    <h1>Test</h1>
                    <p>
                        After you finish coding, test your code! Run your examples through your solution and make sure it works. 
                        Testing can help you identify any mistakes you made or edge cases you missed.
                    </p>
                    <div class="circle">6</div>
                    <h1>Communicate</h1>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, communicate as you go. Talk through examples, design, challenges you are running into,  
                        etc. Keep the communication flowing throughout. This is super important for success, regardless of the 
                        validity of your solution.
